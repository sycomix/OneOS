Write a markdown parsable JSON dictionnary that contains the following keys:

-   'action': Next action to answer the user query. Can be any of [{tool_names}, 'final_answer'].
-   'action_input': Input of the action.

If you have already taken some actions, use what you observed from them to answer the user.

Your next action is the answer. User only sees the input of the 'final_answer' action. You should always use it once you can answer the user query.

Example:
```json
{{
